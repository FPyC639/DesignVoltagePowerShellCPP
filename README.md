# PowerShell C++ Design Voltage Fetcher

This console application retrieves the Design Voltage from a single battery in a computer. This program is written in C++, and it interfaces with C++ to obtain the result from PowerShell. The PowerShell Command is 
```PowerShell
Get-WmiObject Win32_Battery | Select DesignVoltage).DesignVoltage
```
In lieu of this I plan to play around with this and see what other things I can do with this knowledge.

This is the C++ Output.
